Sprinklers 2: Return of the Alfalfa

Question:
Farmer John has a small field in the shape of an N by N grid (1<=N<=2000). He has two types
of sprinklers. A sweet corn sprinkler in (I, J) sprinkles all squares to the bottom left
(all (i, j) with i >= I and j <= J). An alfalfa sprinker in (I, J) sprints all squares to
the top right (all (i, j) with i <= I and j >= J). Sweet-corn-sprinkled squares can grow
sweet corn, alfalfa-sprinkled squares can grow alfalfa, and squares sprinkled by both can grow nothing.
Help FJ determine the number of ways (mod 10^9 + 7) to install sprnklers in his field so that every square
is fertile.

Some of the squares are occupied by woolly cows. Sprinklers cannot be installed where there is already a sprinkler,
or there is a woolly cow.

Solution:
